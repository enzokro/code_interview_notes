    Main logic uses a stack, building up from the fact that valid sub-expressions always builds up from a single set of parentheses.

    The main trip up is in edge cases: 
        whether the stack is empty at the end
        when we reach a closing bracket, is there anything on the stack? (the only place a closer could be)
        what if we are given no parentheses, or a single one?

    NOTE: above is technically O(n/2) since we don't add the closer to the stack.

'''Implementing a FIFO queue with two stacks
The main idea is keeping two stacks, and shuffling items from one to the other to keep the "FO" ordering when popping.

When adding a new element:
    Move over all elems in s1
    Append new elem to empty s1
    Move back over all elems from s2

    Example: with elements so far
    pushing (b, c, d)...
    -> push(b)
        [], []
        [b], []
    -> push(c)
        [], [b] # move all elems to other stack(in this case, only b)
        [c], [b] # added new element
        [c, b], [] # popped b from other stack, appended to first stack
        # now, poppping from s1 would rightly return the firstly added b
    -> push(d)
        [], [b, c]
        [d], [b, c]
        [d, c, b], [] # if we popped everything, would get correct queue FIFO order: b, c, d

    # driving the point home, with slightly different order
    [b, c, d], []
    -> push(a) (assuming new order of push: d, c, b)
    [], [d, c, b]
    [a], [d, c, b]
    [a, b, c, d]
    -> popall(): [d, c, b, a], as expected

    Rather, it only adds to s1.
    Then, when a pop is requested, we move over all elements from s1 to s2.
        Thanks to the inverse ordering, the top element of s2 will be what we're after

    Then, peek/pop continue returning from s2 which has the correct FIFO ordering until its empty
    Then, once s2 is empty, we can resume the process with incoming s1
        The values so far in s1, that will eventually be popped/appended to s2, will retain the original, intended FIFO ordering.

    AMORTIZED: instead of moving over each elem to s2, and back again
                Move chunks over, as needed, and leverage the implicit FIFO ordering

        '''Notes on a clever solution: the Boyer-Moore voting algorithm
            Intuition
            If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as +1+1 and instances of any other element as -1âˆ’1, summing them would make it obvious that the majority element is indeed the majority element.

            Algorithm
            Essentially, what Boyer-Moore does is look for a suffix sufsuf of nums where suf[0]suf[0] is the majority element in that suffix. To do this, we maintain a count, which is incremented whenever we see an instance of our current candidate for majority element and decremented whenever we see anything else. Whenever count equals 0, we effectively forget about everything in nums up to the current index and consider the current number as the candidate for majority element. It is not immediately obvious why we can get away with forgetting prefixes of nums - consider the following examples (pipes are inserted to separate runs of nonzero count).

            [7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 7, 7]

            Here, the 7 at index 0 is selected to be the first candidate for majority element. count will eventually reach 0 after index 5 is processed, so the 5 at index 6 will be the next candidate. In this case, 7 is the true majority element, so by disregarding this prefix, we are ignoring an equal number of majority and minority elements - therefore, 7 will still be the majority element in the suffix formed by throwing away the first prefix.

            [7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 5, 5, 5, 5]

            Now, the majority element is 5 (we changed the last run of the array from 7s to 5s), but our first candidate is still 7. In this case, our candidate is not the true majority element, but we still cannot discard more majority elements than minority elements (this would imply that count could reach -1 before we reassign candidate, which is obviously false).

            Therefore, given that it is impossible (in both cases) to discard more majority elements than minority elements, we are safe in discarding the prefix and attempting to recursively solve the majority element problem for the suffix. Eventually, a suffix will be found for which count does not hit 0, and the majority element of that suffix will necessarily be the same as the majority element of the overall array.
